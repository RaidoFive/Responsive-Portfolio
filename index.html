		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit no-no-no-no-no....I'm not gonna do that to ya.  Hi, my name is Steve Hopkins, and welcome to the results of my first homework assignment in Coding bootcamp.  This page was built from scratch in my first week, and I'm quite happy with it.  It's not perfect, but hey, you can read this, so I got something right!  So, here's a bit about me.  At the time of this writing, I'm 33, married, and on the path to a new career in web development.  To keep myself sane, I read.  Quite a lot, really, at minimum an hour every day.  My wife and I keep a library that spans over 500 books now. It was about 450ish when I introduced myself to my classmates, but then my wife and I bought a bundle of 83 books by R.L. Stine.  Y'know, that guy that wrote the Goosebumps books?  Yeah.  I'll read a lot of things. particular I enjoy fantasies, from J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, to George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Nothing beats sitting back with a good book while enjoying a good beer (and I mean <em>good</em> beer).  That's another, somewhat lesser interest of mine.  I'm no expert, but I do enjoy partaking in the fruits of the craft beer movement.  So there you go.  A couple factoids about me.  Thanks for reading and having a look at my page.  I'll end this on a quote: "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." -- Lao Tzu</p>
